Booky Store 

MVC Project

I have developed a comprehensive project that encompasses user registration, login, and signup functionalities. The application shows books, categories, users, and roles providing users with the ability to add, delete, and modify these elements. To ensure secure access, I have implemented an authorization that restricts access to certain pages unless the user is logged in. Additionally, a 'Remember Me' feature is incorporated; when selected, the browser saves the user's token, eliminating the need for login upon revisiting the site. However, if the user opts not to use this feature, they will be prompted to log in upon returning to the site

Product: The product section displays all available products, providing options to create, modify, and delete products as needed, It is possible to arrange items based on specific criteria. For instance, if I wish to arrange them by name, I can click on the arrow next to the name, and the ordering can be done either in descending or ascending order. Additionally, a search functionality is available for various criteria. Furthermore, I've implemented the option to display products in sets of 10, 25, 50, or 100 for user convenience
